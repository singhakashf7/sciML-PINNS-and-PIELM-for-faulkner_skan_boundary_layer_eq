# sciML-PINNS-and-PIELM-for-faulkner_skan_boundary_layer_eq

This is the detailed implementation of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and Physics Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELM) to reconstruct the solution of several interesting problems
### 1- Faulkner Skan equation :

captured general flow solutions at arbitrary wall angle , Demonstrated that PIELMs are much efficient solution method as compared to PINNs  
### 2- Wave equation :

Successfully Captured temporal dynamics which is inherent in this problem using Physics Informed Neural networks
